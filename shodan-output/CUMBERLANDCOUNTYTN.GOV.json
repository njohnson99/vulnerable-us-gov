The court determined that the act of egg throwing in this case was not a distinct and intervening act from the use or operation of the vehicle, as the speeding vehicle created speed and kinetic energy for the egg(s) which were crucial in causing the extensive damage it did.</p>\n<p><strong><div class=\"show_more\"><p class=\"wpsm-show\" style=\"color: 000000; font-size: 100%; text-align: center;\"> Show More</p><div class=\"wpsm-content wpsm-content-hide\"></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>The Facts</em></strong></p>\n<p>The plaintiff in <em>Gilbraith v Intact Insurance Company</em><a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\"><sup>1</sup></a> was a pedestrian walking along a sidewalk with her friend when a car approached her from the opposite direction. The front passenger threw an egg or multiple eggs at her, striking her right eye, which caused serious and permanent injuries.<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\"><sup>2</sup></a> It was believed that the car was travelling 10-20km/h above the speed limit, and it did not stop. Both the car and its occupants remained unidentified.<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\"><sup>3</sup></a></p>\n<p>As a result, the plaintiff commenced a claim against Intact Insurance Company (\u201cIntact\u201d) in accordance with the OPCF 44R Family Protection Coverage Endorsement of the standard Ontario automobile insurance policy. The relevant section of the Endorsement provided:</p>\n<p>Insuring Agreement</p>\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; font-size: .8em; font-style: normal;\"><p>[The] insurer shall indemnify an eligible claimant for the amount that he or she is legally entitled to recover from an inadequately insured motorist as compensatory damages in respect of the bodily injury to or death of an insured person\u00a0<em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>arising directly or indirectly from the use or operation of an automobile.</strong>\u00a0[Emphasis added]</span></em><a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\"><sup>4</sup></a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Intact moved for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries did not arise directly or indirectly from the use or operation of an automobile, but rather by an egg thrown from a passenger in the vehicle.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Law</em></strong></p>\n<p>It is well-established that courts apply a two-part test in determining entitlement to coverage under the OPCF 44R Endorsement for bodily injuries or death that arose \u201cdirectly or indirectly from the use or operation of an automobile\u201d. The two parts are: (i) the purpose test, and (ii) the modified causation test:</p>\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; font-size: .8em; font-style: normal;\"><p>Purpose test (\u201cuse or operation\u201d): Did the incident occur in the course of the ordinary and well known activities of automobiles?<br />\nModified causation test (\u201carising directly or indirectly\u201d): Was there an unbroken chain of causation linking the claimed loss or injuries to the use and operation of the motor vehicles, which is shown to be more than simply fortuitous or \u201cbut\u201d for?<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\"><sup>5</sup></a></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Purpose Test</em></strong></p>\n<p>The purpose test generally has a lower threshold where the court merely examines whether the incident occurred through the use or operation of ordinary and well-known activities of automobiles. Transporting individuals or cargo including rocks and guns have been found to meet the purpose test.<a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\"><sup>6</sup></a></p>\n<p>It is notable that here, Intact argued that the motor vehicle was used as a catapult for an egg, which was not an ordinary and well-known use to which motor vehicles are put. The Ontario Superior Court rejected this contention and found that the driver was simply transporting passengers and cargo (the egg(s)) which was an ordinary and well-known activity of automobiles.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Modified Causation Test</em></strong></p>\n<p>The court\u2019s finding in the modified causation test appears to stand directly against the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Vytlingam</em>.</p>\n<p>Intact relied upon the courts in <em>Vytlingam and Russo</em> to argue that the modified causation test was not satisfied due to a broken chain of causation. In <em>Russo</em>, the plaintiff was injured in a restaurant due to a drive-by shooting. The Court of Appeal found that the shooting was a distinct and intervening act completely independent from the use or operation of the van.<a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\"><sup>7</sup></a></p>\n<p><em>Vytlingam</em> involved tortfeasors who drove to an overpass with rocks, before exiting the vehicle and dropping the rocks onto the road below, causing catastrophic injuries. The Supreme Court of Canada found that the chain of causation was broken as the tort, which consisted of dropping rocks from the highway, was separate from the use and operation of the motor vehicle.<a href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\"><sup>8</sup></a></p>\n<p>In particular, the Supreme Court in <em>Vytlingam</em> explicitly rejected the British Columbia Court of Appeal\u2019s finding in <em>Chan v Insurance Corp. of British Columbia</em>,<a href=\"#_ftn9\" name=\"_ftnref9\"><sup>9</sup></a> which involved a passenger injured by a brick thrown from an oncoming vehicle.<a href=\"#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref10\"><sup>10</sup></a> The court in <em>Chan</em> found it was impossible to isolate the throwing of the brick from the use or operation of the vehicle as two entirely separate and distinct acts; instead, it said that operation was \u201cpart and parcel\u201d to the throwing of the brick.<a href=\"#_ftn11\" name=\"_ftnref11\"><sup>11</sup></a> The court in <em>Vytlingam</em> opined:</p>\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; font-size: .8em; font-style: normal;\"><p>\u2026Nevertheless, if the analysis had focused on the elements of the tort that gave rise to the tortfeasor\u2019s liability (as it should have), the fact the brick was thrown from a car rather than a horse does not qualify it as a motoring activity. The rock throwing was an intervening act. Neither in <em>Chan</em> nor in the present appeal was the tortfeasor at fault as a motorist.<a href=\"#_ftn12\" name=\"_ftnref12\"><sup>12</sup></a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Justice Sosna distinguished this case from <em>Vytlingam</em> because the egg was thrown from a speeding vehicle, where he found that the speed was crucial to changing the likelihood of the plaintiff\u2019s injury from unlikely to \u201cmore likely than not\u201d.<a href=\"#_ftn13\" name=\"_ftnref13\"><sup>13</sup></a> As a result, he concluded there was an unbroken chain of causation as throwing the egg(s) from a speeding vehicle was not a distinct and intervening act independent from the use or operation of the vehicle.<a href=\"#_ftn14\" name=\"_ftnref14\"><sup>14</sup></a></p>\n<p>The court here essentially adopts the reasoning in <em>Chan</em> and justified its approach by considering the speed of the motor vehicle. It found that where speeding increased the likelihood of the injury, an unbroken chain of causation linked the injuries and damages to the use and operation of the motor vehicle.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></p>\n<p>Although the court distinguished its facts from those of <em>Vytlingam</em>, its findings muddy the waters on how the modified causation test should be applied, particularly when items are propelled from a moving vehicle resulting in injury. <em>Chan</em> found that in such circumstances, there is no intervening or distinct act, whereas <em>Vytlingam</em> explicitly overruled <em>Chan</em>. The court in <em>Gilbraith</em> did not clearly address why speeding, which affected the balance of probabilities of injuries, resulted in an unbroken chain of events. As a result, this decision leaves the fate of future cases involving projectiles from a vehicle that result in injury unclear.</p>\n<p><small><strong>Footnotes</strong></small><br />\n<small><br />\n<a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\"><sup>1</sup></a> <em>Gilbraith v Intact Insurance Company</em>,2019 ONSC 1875, [<em>Gilbraith</em>].<br />\n<a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\"><sup>2</sup></a> <em>Gilbraith</em> at paras 7-9.<br />\n<a href=\"#_ftnref3\" name=\"_ftn3\"><sup>3</sup></a> <em>Gilbraith</em> at paras 3 and 61.<br />\n<a href=\"#_ftnref4\" name=\"_ftn4\"><sup>4</sup></a> <em>Gilbraith</em> at para 28.<br />\n<a href=\"#_ftnref5\" name=\"_ftn5\"><sup>5</sup></a> <em>Gilbraith</em> at para 33, <em>Vytlingam (Litigation Guardian of) v Farmer</em>, 2007 SCC 46 at para 12, [<em>Vytlingam</em>].<br />\n<a href=\"#_ftnref6\" name=\"_ftn6\"><sup>6</sup></a> <em>Vytlingam</em> at para 33, <em>Russo</em> at para 24 (ONCA).<br />\n<a href=\"#_ftnref7\" name=\"_ftn7\"><sup>7</sup></a> <em>Russo v John Doe</em>, 2009 ONCA 305, at para 34.<br />\n<a href=\"#_ftnref8\" name=\"_ftn8\"><sup>8</sup></a> <em>Vytlingam</em> at para 38.<br />\n<a href=\"#_ftnref9\" name=\"_ftn9\"><sup>9</sup></a> <em>Vytlingam</em> at para 31.<br />\n<a href=\"#_ftnref10\" name=\"_ftn10\"><sup>10</sup></a> <em>Traders</em>,60 ACWS (3d) 605, [<em>Chan</em>].<br />\n<a href=\"#_ftnref11\" name=\"_ftn11\"><sup>11</sup></a> <em>Chan</em> at para 30.<br />\n<a href=\"#_ftnref12\" name=\"_ftn12\"><sup>12</sup></a> <em>Vytlingam</em> at para 31.<br />\n<a href=\"#_ftnref13\" name=\"_ftn13\"><sup>13</sup></a> <em>Gilbraith</em> at paras 56 and 61.<br />\n<a href=\"#_ftnref14\" name=\"_ftn14\"><sup>14</sup></a> <em>Gilbraith</em> at para 62.<br />\n</small></p>\n<p><small><em><strong>Victoria Yang</strong> Victoria Yang is an associate at <strong>Theall Group LLP</strong> and maintains a broad commercial litigation practice.

The two lived together and the policy contained an exclusion for claims arising from injury to \u201cany person residing in [the] household\u201d. However, the court concluded that the daughter was a \u201ctenant\u201d under the policy and therefore the exclusion did not apply. In the absence of explicit terms, the court concluded that the insured had a reasonable expectation of coverage for claims made by tenants, even if that tenant was a family member.</p>\n<p><strong><div class=\"show_more\"><p class=\"wpsm-show\" style=\"color: 000000; font-size: 100%; text-align: center;\"> Show More</p><div class=\"wpsm-content wpsm-content-hide\"></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>The Facts</em></strong></p>\n<p>Traders General Insurance Company v Elizabeth Gibson <a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\"><sup>1</sup></a> involved a daughter, Betty Gibson (\u201cBetty\u201d), born July 22, 1949, who, except for 10 months, lived at her mother\u2019s property her entire adulthood until 2016. Since high school graduation, Betty paid rent to her mother, Elizabeth Gibson (\u201cElizabeth\u201d), and shared daily living tasks as well as various maintenance and upkeep costs with her.</p>\n<p>An accident occurred on March 31, 2014 when Betty and her mother were waiting for a taxi to take them to medical appointments. Her mother was sweeping the porch and when the taxi arrived, reached to hand over the broom to Betty on the porch. When Betty leaned over to get the broom, she fell from the porch as the railing came down with her. As a result, she sustained bodily injuries and sued her mother, the contractor, his company, and a neighbor.</p>\n<p>Traders General Insurance Company (\u201cTraders\u201d) brought a coverage application in the course of trial for a declaration that it did not have to defend or indemnify Elizabeth.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Coverage</em></strong></p>\n<p>The mother\u2019s homeowner policy provided personal liability protection, which included coverage for compensatory damages due to unintentional bodily injury arising out of her \u201cownership, use or occupancy\u201d of the premises. However, the policy included the following exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; font-size: .8em; font-style: normal;\"><p>We do not ensure claims made against you arising from:<br />\n5. Bodily injury to you or any person residing in your household other than a residence employee<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\"><sup>2</sup></a>. [emphasis added]</p></blockquote>\n<p>Traders relied on this exclusion (the \u201cHousehold Exclusion\u201d) and argued that, because Betty \u201cresided\u201d at her mother\u2019s household at the time of the accident, coverage for a defence and indemnity against Betty\u2019s action was excluded.</p>\n<p>During its analysis, the court decided that the Household Exclusion\u2019s purpose was to prevent potential collusion between the insured and family members residing within a household. Although they were family members occupying the same residence, Elizabeth argued that Betty was either a \u201cresidence employee\u201d or a \u201ctenant\u201d and thus her claims against Elizabeth would not be subject to the Household Exclusion.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Residence Employee Argument</em></strong></p>\n<p>Elizabeth relied on two arguments on this application. First, she argued that Betty was a \u201cresident employee\u201d retained to perform household services or duties in exchange for a low monthly rent. As quoted above, the Household Exclusion relied on by Traders contained an explicit exception for claims made by \u201cresidence employees\u201d.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth\u2019s policy defined \u201cresidence employees\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; font-size: .8em; font-style: normal;\"><p>\u201cResidence Employee\u201d means a person employed by you to perform duties in connection with the maintenance or use of the premises. This includes persons who perform household or domestic services or duties of a similar nature for you. This does not include contractors or sub-contractors. It also does not cover persons while performing duties in connection with your business.<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\"><sup>3</sup></a></p></blockquote>\n<p>The court found that Betty could not be considered a \u201cresidence employee\u201d as there was no \u201cemployer and employee\u201d relationship between her and Elizabeth, nor was there a \u201cfamily business\u201d. Further, the court noted that Betty did not have a schedule or list of duties, and she had discretion over the services or duties she performed\u2014for instance, when her health was poor she did no tasks at all.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Tenant Argument</em></strong></p>\n<p>Elizabeth argued, in the alternative, that Betty was a tenant and thus her claims against Elizabeth should be covered under the Traders policy. Traders argued that the Household Exclusion applied.</p>\n<p>As noted above, the court had already decided that the purpose of the Household Exclusion was only to protect insurers from collusion between family members who were residing together. Here, although Betty and Elizabeth were family, the evidence was clear that Betty had been paying a fixed rent since 1994. Faced with this bona fides tenancy between family, the court was tasked with deciding whether the Household Exclusion still applied due to Betty\u2019s tenancy.</p>\n<p>Noting the general rules for insurance policy construction, including that coverage terms be interpreted broadly and exclusion clauses be interpreted narrowly, the court considered the intentions of the parties at the time that the policy was issued. The court held that:</p>\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; font-size: .8em; font-style: normal;\"><p>I am of the view that it had to have been in the reasonable contemplation of the parties that the owner may have rented a room to a tenant for remuneration, and that the owner may call upon that policy if a tenant were injured on the property, as the policy was obtained for the express purpose of providing liability coverage in respect of the ownership, use and occupancy of the property. \u2026 [I]t would have been in the mind of Elizabeth when she first purchased the policy of insurance that she would be covered for liability for accidents occurring in the home for tenants. The opposite conclusion would be contrary to the reasonable expectations of Elizabeth and to the ordinary person as to the coverage purchased. Therefore, in my view, if Betty were a tenant, then her injury would be covered by the Traders policy of insurance.<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\"><sup>4</sup></a> [emphasis added]</p></blockquote>\n<p>This conclusion follows the general rule that a coverage grant be interpreted broadly. Because the policy provided coverage for all injury arising from the \u201cownership, use and occupancy\u201d of the premises, it was reasonable to conclude this term covered injury to \u201ctenants\u201d \u2013 with a tenancy being an ordinary \u201cuse\u201d of the premises. By extension, the court concluded this interpretation would accord with Elizabeth\u2019s reasonable expectations when purchasing the Traders policy.</p>\n<p>While the court did not explicitly address the Household Exclusion in its analysis, the above conclusion also follows the general rule that exclusion clauses are to be interpreted narrowly. Because the court decided that the Household Exclusion had the narrow purpose of avoiding collusion between family members, it follows that the exclusion ought not to apply to claims made by bona fides \u201ctenants\u201d, even if those tenants are family.</p>\n<p>To determine whether Betty was truly a \u201ctenant, in the absence of a definition for \u201ctenants\u201d in the policy, the court established two criteria: (i) that the person occupy the property in question, and (ii) that there is an exchange of consideration that allows the tenant to occupy the property.<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\"><sup>5</sup></a> The court found that, in this case, both requirements were satisfied.<a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\"><sup>6</sup></a> As such, the court dismissed the application, concluding that Betty was a \u201ctenant\u201d and her claims against Elizabeth were covered under the Traders policy. The court ordered that Traders continue to defend Elizabeth and indemnify her, if required.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></p>\n<p>This case serves as a reminder that policyholder intentions at the time of the purchase of insurance can be critically important. These intentions can inform the interpretation of a policy in the face of ambiguity. While an exclusion applying to \u201cany person residing in your household\u201d at the premises could have been interpreted to include any \u201ctenants\u201d, the court relied on the intentions of the parties to support a narrow view of that exclusion. Here, the court refused to extend a vaguely worded exclusion to deny coverage to a policyholder who \u2013 in the court\u2019s contemplation \u2013 would have reasonably expected coverage for claims of bodily injury by \u201ctenants\u201d under the policy.</p>\n<p><small><strong>Footnotes</strong></small><br />\n<small><br />\n<a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\"><sup>1</sup></a> <em>Traders General Insurance Company v Elizabeth Gibson</em>, 2019 ONSC 1599, [Traders].<br />\n<a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\"><sup>2</sup></a> <em>Traders</em> at para 14.<br />\n<a href=\"#_ftnref3\" name=\"_ftn3\"><sup>3</sup></a> <em>Traders</em> at para 16.<br />\n<a href=\"#_ftnref4\" name=\"_ftn4\"><sup>4</sup></a> <em>Traders</em> at para 38.<br />\n<a href=\"#_ftnref5\" name=\"_ftn5\"><sup>5</sup></a> <em>Traders</em> at para 39.<br />\n<a href=\"#_ftnref6\" name=\"_ftn6\"><sup>6</sup></a> <em>Traders</em> at para 40-41.<br />\n</small></p>\n<p><small><em><strong>Victoria Yang</strong> Victoria Yang is an associate at <strong>Theall Group LLP</strong> and maintains a broad commercial litigation practice.

Theall</strong>, Partner<br />\n&amp;<strong> Shaun A. Hashim</strong>, Litigation Associate</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In <em>Pembridge Insurance Company of Canada v Chu</em>,<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a> a judge of Ontario\u2019s Superior Court of Justice recently concluded that insurance policies ought to be interpreted differently when multiple insurers are involved. In this problematic decision, the court deviated from the long-standing rule that exclusion clauses should be interpreted \u201cnarrowly\u201d. Remarkably, the court began with the assumption that one of the insurance policies <em>must</em> respond to the loss. Based on this assumption, the court decided that different rules of contractual interpretation would apply.</p>\n<p>This case is problematic because (i) it conflicts with the well-established rules for policy interpretation; (ii) it suggests that a policy can be interpreted by looking outside the contract to its effect on a non-party; and (iii) the assumption that one policy must <em>indemnify </em>the insured was both irrelevant and an improper consideration on a duty to defend application. Absent appellate guidance, this decision may create confusion and unintended consequences on coverage applications involving multiple insurers.</p>\n<p><strong><div class=\"show_more\"><p class=\"wpsm-show\" style=\"color: 000000; font-size: 100%; text-align: center;\"> Show More</p><div class=\"wpsm-content wpsm-content-hide\"></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Facts</strong></p>\n<p>The case in <em>Pembridge </em>involved allegations that Chu, after a motor vehicle accident, left his vehicle to engage in physical violence and threatening behavior. In a typical \u201croad rage\u201d incident, he allegedly hit the window of another vehicle, while yelling and making other gestures. Because of Chu\u2019s conduct, the underlying plaintiffs alleged that they feared for their lives. Chu was insured under a Pembridge homeowner policy which covered \u201cbodily injury or property damages\u201d. The policy contained an exclusion for claims \u201carising from the ownership, use or operation of a motorized vehicle\u2026\u201d.<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a> Dominion, Chu\u2019s auto insurer, accepted the duty to defend for allegations arising out of the use, ownership or operation of the vehicle. Dominion argued that that the allegations of Chu\u2019s conduct, after he left his vehicle, triggered a duty to defend under the Pembridge policy.<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\">[3]</a></p>\n<p><strong>A False Premise and Errors in Privity</strong></p>\n<p>The court began its analysis by correctly articulating the well-settled principles for interpreting insurance policies. The court acknowledged that, generally, coverage terms are to be interpreted broadly and exclusion clauses are to be interpreted narrowly.</p>\n<p>However, when it turned to interpreting the exclusion clause in question, the court decided that the narrow interpretation rule need not apply because, in the court\u2019s view, the insured would have coverage no matter the outcome of the analysis. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; font-size: .8em; font-style: normal;\"><p>In this case, however, regardless of how the exclusion clause is interpreted, one of the insurers will be providing coverage to the insured in relation to the insured\u2019s actions after exiting the vehicle, and the other will not. If I were to interpret the exclusion clause more broadly, this would leave Dominion responsible for following through with the coverage. If I were to interpret the provision more narrowly, this would make Pembridge liable for the conduct.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This was a false premise that gave rise to numerous errors in this decision. Here, the court assumes that only one insurer can respond to a loss, when it is entirely possible that both policies could respond. The error in this analysis was further illustrated when the motion judge concluded in the next paragraph that \u201cbetween Dominion and Pembridge, in light of the jurisprudence, it is more appropriate for Dominion to provide coverage in this case.\u201d In effect the court concluded that only one policy would respond, and that it was charged with deciding which appeared to be \u201cmore appropriate.\u201d The judge misdirected himself on what the issue was and how it should be determined.</p>\n<p>It is well settled that a policy of insurance is to be interpreted by reference to the intent of the insurer and the insured alone \u2013 even if the dispute is \u201cas between\u201d insurers. For example, in dealing with an \u201cother insurance\u201d exclusion, the Supreme Court of Canada in <em>Family Insurance Corp. v. Lombard Canada Ltd.</em> ruled that the intentions of one insurer regarding <em>another</em> insurer was irrelevant. Justice Bastarache wrote:</p>\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; font-size: .8em; font-style: normal;\"><p>[T]he interpretation exercise is concerned with determining the intentions of the insurers <em><u>vis-\u00e0-vis</u></em><u> the insured</u>. &#8230; In the case of an insurance contract, the entire agreement between the insurer and the insured is contained within the policy itself and evidence of the parties&#8217; intentions must be sought in the words they chose. \u2026 In the absence of privity of contract between the parties, the unilateral and subjective intentions of the insurers, unaware of one another at the time the contracts were made, are simply irrelevant. [emphasis added]<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\">[4]</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>The Ontario Court of Appeal in <em>TD General Insurance Company v. Intact Insurance Company</em> recently affirmed and relied on the conclusion in <em>Family Insurance Corp</em>. The Court noted that in cases of overlapping insurance \u201c\u2026insurance policies themselves must be construed to determine the liability of each insurer, <u>and the court should not refer to surrounding circumstances or look outside the policies</u>. [emphasis added]\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\">[5]</a></p>\n<p>But the court in the <em>Pembridge</em> did just that when it began with the false assumption that, no matter the outcome, at least one insurer would have to indemnify Chu for the loss. As discussed in the section below, that false assumption distorted the motion judge\u2019s interpretation of the exclusion clause. As discussed later in this article, the false assumption also caused an improper finding on the ultimate responsibility for indemnity.</p>\n<p><strong>Errors in Interpretation</strong></p>\n<p>Informed by the improperly assumed result, the court proceeded with its analysis of the Pembridge policy. The exclusion in the Pembridge policy read:</p>\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; font-size: .8em;\"><p>You are not insured for claims made against you arising from:<br />\nThe ownership, use, or operation of any motorized vehicles, trailer or watercraft, except those insured in this policy.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On reading this exclusion, the court concluded that Chu\u2019s road rage incident \u201carose from\u201d the use or operation of a motor vehicle. In reaching that conclusion, the court relied on: (i) s. 239 of the <em>Insurance Act</em> which specifically requires that automobile policies provide coverage for loss or damage caused \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d in operation of a vehicle; and (ii) <em>Amos v Insurance Corp. of British Columbia</em>, which afforded a broad, liberal interpretation of the phrase, \u201carising from\u201d.<a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\">[6]</a></p>\n<p>The court found that cases interpreting the <em>Insurance Act</em> and following <em>Amos </em>have \u201cvery broadly construed\u201d the phrase \u201carising from\u201d.<a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\">[7]</a> In relying on this line of cases, the court specifically observed, but ignored, that the Pembridge policy did not contain the phrase \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d. The court further specifically observed, but ignored, that the line of cases cited by Pembridge arose in the context of interpreting <u>coverage grants</u> rather than <u>coverage exclusions</u>. The motion judge reasoned that because the interpretation analysis was being conducted \u201cas between\u201d insurers, the typical rules of interpretation do not apply.</p>\n<p>This approach contradicts well-established Supreme Court of Canada precedent, which has repeatedly affirmed that clauses granting coverage are to be construed broadly and clauses removing coverage are to be construed narrowly.<a href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\">[8]</a> The court offered no reason to deviate from this rule other than its improper conclusion that the Dominion\u2019s policy would respond if the Pembridge policy did not.</p>\n<p>In fact, the Supreme Court of Canada dealt with this very issue in <em>Derksen v. 539938 Ontario Ltd.</em> In <em>Derksen, </em>the Court held that the <em>Amos</em> interpretation of \u201carising out of\u201d ought not to apply to cases interpreting insurance exclusions:</p>\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; font-size: .8em; font-style: normal;\"><p>It is clear however that Amos is distinguishable from the case at bar on the basis that the relevant provision in that case was a coverage clause, as opposed to an exclusion clause. It is well-established that, in the construction of insurance contracts, coverage provisions should be construed broadly and exclusion clauses narrowly. Amos is of no assistance in this appeal.<a href=\"#_ftn9\" name=\"_ftnref9\">[9]</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>By broadly construing the exclusion, the court in <em>Pembridge </em>applied <em>Amos</em> in direct contravention of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Derksen</em>.</p>\n<p>In line with <em>Derksen, </em>the Dominion specifically relied on cases dealing with similar exclusions which show that road rage incidents \u201cbreak the chain of causation\u201d so they are deemed not to arise out of the use or operation of the vehicle.<a href=\"#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref10\">[10]</a> This characterization of road rage incidents has been relied on by the Supreme Court of Canada in <em>Law Union &amp; Rock Insurance Co. v Moore\u2019s Taxi Ltd.</em><a href=\"#_ftn11\" name=\"_ftnref11\">[11]</a> and has been reaffirmed by appellate courts.<a href=\"#_ftn12\" name=\"_ftnref12\">[12]</a> The court ignored these cases, preferring the broader interpretations afforded by the coverage (and not exclusion) analysis in <em>Amos</em>. As a result, the court maintained that Chu\u2019s actions after exiting the vehicle were \u201cincident\u201d to the ownership, use or operation of the vehicle.<a href=\"#_ftn13\" name=\"_ftnref13\">[13]</a> Accordingly, the court concluded that Pembridge had no duty to defend, and therefore no duty to indemnify.</p>\n<p>Notably, toward the end of the decision, the court briefly acknowledged that an intentional act exclusion might also apply in this case.<a href=\"#_ftn14\" name=\"_ftnref14\">[14]</a> Although the court did not conduct the analysis, it is noteworthy that, given the underlying facts as pleaded, it is possible \u2013 but unclear, without a full factual record \u2013 that such an exclusion might apply. That analysis would be guided by the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Non-Marine Underwriters, Lloyd;s London v. Scalera</em>, which dealt with intentional act exclusions and the intent to cause harm.</p>\n<p><strong>Errors regarding the Duty to Indemnify</strong></p>\n<p>Much of the analysis in <em>Pembridge</em> decision is centred upon the court\u2019s assumption that at least one insurer would ultimately be required to indemnify the insured. Because of this assumption, and given its ruling in favour of Pembridge, the court improperly went on to definitively rule on the Dominion\u2019s duty to indemnify. This ruling was inappropriate on a duty to defend application.</p>\n<p>After deciding that the term \u201carising from\u201d was broad enough to capture the road rage incident, and further deciding that the incident did not \u201cbreak the chain of causation\u201d, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; font-size: .8em; font-style: normal;\"><p><u>I am finding that as between Pembridge and Dominion, Dominion will be required to provide the requisite coverage</u>. Dennis Chu&#8217;s actions after exiting the vehicle is <u>now deemed to be incident to the ownership, use or operation of a vehicle</u>. This finding should not be revisited by the trial judge.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This finding contradicts well-established precedent that the duty to indemnify should not generally be determined on a duty to defend application. To find there is no duty to defend, a court must find there is not even a \u201cmere possibility\u201d of coverage under the policy.<a href=\"#_ftn15\" name=\"_ftnref15\">[15]</a> Therefore, the sole question on the application is whether the Court can conclusively rule out the \u201cmere possibility\u201d that an insurer might have to provide indemnity based solely on the pleadings. Where there is no \u201cmere possibility\u201d of coverage, it is appropriate to rule on the duty to indemnify. But where the duty to defend exists or is assumed \u2013 as was the case with Dominion \u2013 it is inappropriate to make a definitive finding on indemnity.</p>\n<p>The policy reasons for this are clear and compelling. In most cases, the duty to indemnify will turn on the ultimate findings of fact at trial and the basis upon which liability is imposed on the insured. Without the benefit of a trial, the court is not in a position to make a finding that the insurer has a legal obligation to indemnify because the indemnity claim has not yet crystalized.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>The decision in <em>Pembridge</em> is clearly problematic. The conclusion that an insurance policy ought to be interpreted differently because another insurance policy might respond is simply wrong.</p>\n<p>The critical error in <em>Pembridge</em> occurred when the court assumed that only one insurer could, and must, provide coverage. That assumption gave rise to all of the other errors in this case. Because the court assumes there will be coverage for Chu, no matter the outcome, it wrongly concluded that the normal rules of policy interpretation do not apply. Absent the proper rules of interpretation, the court makes a ruling that Pembridge has no duty to defend. Based on the initial error that there must be coverage, no matter the outcome, the court goes further and decides that the Dominion<em> must</em> be responsible and imposes a duty to indemnify.</p>\n<p>The court\u2019s initial assumption creates a false choice between insurers. In deciding that only one insurer can respond to the loss, the court narrows the scope of coverage that might otherwise be available. It is always possible to have two insurance policies that provide different coverage, but both cover the losses. In that case, the insured may very well have the benefit of additional limits of coverage, which would be lost by using the approach adopted in <em>Pembridge</em>.</p>\n<p>The decision in <em>Pembridge</em> runs contrary to basic rules of contractual interpretation and conflicts with well-established precedent. If followed, this case could lead to commercially unreasonable results and could result in eroding the benefits of coverage available to an insured. It is our view that the decision was in error and should be treated as wrongly decided, as it directly contradicts prior decisions of both the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada.</p>\n<p><small><strong>Footnotes</strong></small></p>\n<p><small><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a> <em>Pembridge Insurance Company of Canada v Chu</em>, 2019 ONSC 1359, [<em>Pembridge</em>].</small></p>\n<p><small><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\">[2]</a> <em>Pembridge</em> at para 12.</small></p>\n<p><small><a href=\"#_ftnref3\" name=\"_ftn3\">[3]</a> <em>Pembridge </em>at para 16.</small></p>\n<p><small><a href=\"#_ftnref4\" name=\"_ftn4\">[4]</a> <em>Family Insurance Corp v.

The insurer tried to suggest that a prior loss and misrepresentations on a mortgage application suggested a propensity towards arson or fraud. The judge\u2019s decision demonstrates the heavy burden on an insurer seeking to rely on an arson defence to a fire loss claim.</p>\n<p><strong><div class=\"show_more\"><p class=\"wpsm-show\" style=\"color: 000000; font-size: 100%; text-align: center;\"> Show More</p><div class=\"wpsm-content wpsm-content-hide\"></strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Facts</strong></p>\n<p>The case in <em>Azami v. TD Home and Auto Insurance</em><sup><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a></sup> arose out of a fire in September 2012 that destroyed the plaintiff\u2019s home. Following the fire, the plaintiff made a claim with the defendant insurer under his homeowner\u2019s insurance policy for the loss of his home, its contents and living expenses. During a pre-trial motion, the plaintiff moved to exclude certain evidence relating to two matters of pre-loss conduct.</p>\n<p>First, the plaintiff sought to exclude evidence regarding a prior loss. One year prior to the present loss, the plaintiff made a claim related to a different fire under a previous homeowner\u2019s insurance policy issued by the defendant. The defendant investigated the incident and accepted the claim, as it found the fire to be of indeterminate cause with no evidence of arson. After extensive renovations paid for by the insurer, the plaintiff sold the previous property at a profit, before purchasing his current property a few months later.</p>\n<p>Second, the plaintiff sought to exclude the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage application for the current property. In 2012, the insured purchased the current property and financed the transaction with a mortgage from Home Trust. When he submitted his application to Home Trust, he included a fictitious employment letter misrepresenting that he was employed as a Human Resources Manager at Century 21 Realty Inc., with a fictitious paystub. In reality, he was unemployed.</p>\n<p><strong>The Result</strong></p>\n<p>Although the court found that both pieces of evidence were relevant \u2013 the prior loss was relevant to the issue of bad faith and the mortgage application to the issue of motive \u2013 the evidence was inadmissible.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Prior Loss</em></strong></p>\n<p>As noted above, in 2011, the insured suffered a fire loss where he claimed insurance and received proceeds which he used to purchase the current property. In 2012, the insured listed the current property for sale less than one month before the fire loss and received no offers. The insurer\u2019s theory was that the insured intentionally set fire to his property to improve his precarious financial situation through another insurance claim.</p>\n<p>The insured argued that the insurer\u2019s use of his past conduct was against the evidentiary rule prohibiting the use of bad character evidence and that the insurer could not rely on any recognized exception to that rule. The insured claimed that admitting the evidence would \u201ccast an aura of suspicion over him by suggesting to the jury that there is something peculiar about a person who has two house fires within 18 months\u201d.</p>\n<p>The court found that while the prior loss may have been relevant to the issue of the insurer\u2019s bad faith, it had little probative value and its exclusion would not prejudice the insurer. The court noted that there was other evidence the insurer could rely on to argue that the insured could not escape his financial circumstances by \u2018flipping\u2019 his house for a profit. The court was also concerned that the indeterminate cause of the first fire would raise questions in the juror\u2019s minds and would compel the plaintiff to lead responding evidence. This would substantially increase the length of trial and distract the jury\u2019s focus from the central issue.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Mortgage Application</em></strong></p>\n<p>The insured also objected to the use of the mortgage application on the basis that it was inadmissible as bad character evidence. The court did note that in civil arson cases, courts routinely admit evidence of the insured\u2019s financial history and financial circumstances in assessing motive. Nevertheless, the court excluded the mortgage application. In this case, admitting the application would have encouraged the jury to unfairly conclude that the plaintiff was more likely to commit arson and make a dishonest insurance claim because of his past conduct in relation to his mortgage application \u2013 an application that was entirely unrelated to the issues before the court. The court noted that this was a \u201ctextbook\u201d example of inadmissible bad character evidence.</p>\n<p>The court again considered the prejudicial effects of such evidence, the consequences of a prolonged trial, and that excluding the application would not prejudice the insurer\u2019s ability to establish the insured\u2019s financial circumstances at the time of fire.</p>\n<p><strong>Significance of the Court&#8217;s Findings</strong></p>\n<p>The court in Azami considered three factors in deciding the admissibility issue:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">(i) the prejudicial effects of admitting evidence of prior conduct versus its probative value and, in particular, whether exclusion of the evidence prejudices the defendant\u2019s ability to establish its defence;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">(ii) whether the admission of the evidence would unnecessarily prolong trial due to the insured\u2019s need to respond to the evidence; and</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">(iii) whether the jury\u2019s focus would be distracted from the central issues in dispute.</p>\n<p>This case serves as a reminder that insurers generally cannot admit evidence of an insured\u2019s past dishonest behaviours or claims history. While this limits the insurer\u2019s ability to satisfy its burden, the rule against bad character evidence ensures a fair adjudication of each case on its merits.</p>\n<p><small><strong>Footnotes</strong></small><br />\n<small><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a> <em>Azami v.

Cox</strong>,\u00a0Litigation Associate</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>An Ontario judge recently permitted an insured to amend its claim after the limitation period had expired, to plead additional insurance policies that applied to the same claim and new heads of damages.<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a> The judge\u2019s decision is a sensible one. It protects insureds from having to claim aggravated and punitive damages or a breach of the insurer\u2019s duty of good faith before the evidence underlying those claims is typically available. <strong><div class=\"show_more\"><p class=\"wpsm-show\" style=\"color: 000000; font-size: 100%; text-align: center;\"> Show More</p><div class=\"wpsm-content wpsm-content-hide\"></strong></p>\n<h3><strong>The Facts</strong></h3>\n<p>Peter Sbaraglia held three different long-term disability (LTD) policies issued by Canada Life Assurance Company. In 2011, he made a claim with Canada Life under each policy. In 2012, Canada Life denied his claim. The following year, Mr. Sbaraglia sued Canada Life for breach of contract. Mr. Sbaraglia\u2019s Statement of Claim only identified one of his three LTD policies. His failure to list the other two policies was inadvertent. Mr. Sbaraglia later asked for Canada Life\u2019s consent to add the two policies to the Statement of Claim by way of amendment. Canada Life refused to give its consent, so Mr. Sbaraglia issued a second Statement of Claim in November 2016, which referenced all three policies.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Motion to Amend</strong></h3>\n<p>To avoid the need for multiple proceedings, in August 2017, Mr. Sbaraglia moved to add the missing two policies to his first Statement of Claim by way of amendment. Mr. Sbaraglia also sought to add a claim for punitive and aggravated damages.</p>\n<p>The court granted Mr. Sbaraglia\u2019s motion, finding that there was a history of the three policies being treated as a single unit. When Mr. Sbaraglia made his 2011 claim, he did so under all three policies. Communications in Canada Life\u2019s file, including its 2012 denial letter, referred to the three policies as a single unit. When it received the first Statement of Claim, Canada Life knew that Mr. Sbaraglia was contesting its denial of disability benefits. Although the first Statement of Claim only referred to one policy, Canada Life ought to have known the claim was being made under all three policies.</p>\n<p>The court also accepted the proposed amendment because it did not allege any new and distinct claims unrelated to those made in the first Statement of Claim. Adding allegations of aggravated and punitive damages did not amount to adding a new and distinct claim. A claim for a particular type of damages is a remedy, not a separate claim. Mr. Sbaraglia was also not advancing a new theory of liability. Instead, he simply sought to rely on additional facts (i.e., the existence of the two missing policies) to support an existing breach of contract claim. All of Mr. Sbaraglia\u2019s claims were based on a theory of liability advanced in the first Statement of Claim.</p>\n<p>The final reason for granting Mr. Sbaraglia\u2019s motion was that his proposed amendment would eliminate the need for multiple proceedings.</p>\n<h3><strong>Guidance Regarding the Drafting of Coverage Claims</strong></h3>\n<p><em>Sbaraglia </em>is a well-reasoned decision that provides guidance to insureds. The court sensibly found that allegations of aggravated and punitive damages are not new and distinct claims. A contrary finding would have imposed a strict deadline for bringing such claims. In Ontario, this deadline would usually be two years after the date of the insurer\u2019s denial, although under certain property policies, the deadline is one year after the loss or damage of the insured property.</p>\n<p>The imposition of such a deadline would have an unwanted effect on the preparation of coverage claims. Claims for aggravated and punitive damages do not arise from every policy denial. However, the evidence required to determine whether these claims are warranted is typically not available to an insured until later in the litigation process, potentially after the limitations deadline would have passed.</p>\n<p>Ruling that allegations of aggravated and punitive damages are new and distinct claims would have placed insureds in a difficult position. On the one hand, the court in <em>Sbaraglia </em>notes that claims for aggravated and punitive damages should not be made lightly. However, faced with an early deadline for alleging these damages, insureds would have to include such allegations in every coverage claim, as a matter of course. Insureds would then have to subsequently abandon whatever allegations are not borne out by the evidence, a practice that would waste resources. This would be the only way to protect those claims for aggravated and punitive damages that would be eventually borne out by the evidence.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, <em>Sbaraglia </em>shows that allegations of aggravated and punitive damages are not new and distinct claims. Insureds can rest assured that if they fail to demand aggravated and punitive damages but later discover supporting evidence, they will still be able to make a claim.</p>\n<p>Finally, the court in <em>Sbaraglia</em> noted that when advanced alongside a claim for wrongful denial of policy benefits, a claim for breach of the insurer\u2019s duty of good faith is not a new and distinct claim.<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a> The comments regarding aggravated and punitive damages also apply here. If an insured sues for wrongful denial of policy benefits, he/she can add a claim for breach of the duty of good faith if he/she subsequently discovers evidence supporting that claim.</p>\n<p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a> See <em>Sbaraglia v.

The Court of Appeal&#8217;s recent decision in\u00a0<em>Reeb v. The Guarantee Company of North America</em><sup>1</sup>\u00a0is an application of the test for reasonable apprehension of a conflict of interest in the context of insurer appointed defence counsel. It demonstrates what can happen where instructions given to defence counsel by an insurer conflict with the best interests of the insured.<strong><div class=\"show_more\"><p class=\"wpsm-show\" style=\"color: 000000; font-size: 100%; text-align: center;\"> Show More</p><div class=\"wpsm-content wpsm-content-hide\"></strong></p>\n<p>The underlying action involved a fact scenario reminiscent of the classic holiday movie &#8220;A Christmas Story&#8221;. The action involved a claim brought by James Riley (&#8220;Riley&#8221;), a 14-year-old boy who lost his eye, against Ryan Reeb (&#8220;Reeb&#8221;). Riley and Reeb were playing with pellet guns when Reeb shot Riley in the eye. Reeb was insured through his mother&#8217;s homeowner&#8217;s policy with Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Insurance Company of Canada (&#8220;RSA&#8221;). The homeowner&#8217;s policy had a $1 million third party liability limit. James Riley&#8217;s claim was for $1.5 million.</p>\n<p>RSA defended Reeb under a non-waiver and reservation of rights agreement. The defence counsel appointed by RSA to defend Reeb, then brought an application for a declaration that Reeb was insured under two additional insurance policies (one policy issued to his father and one to his step-mother). This was done at the direction of RSA. The other insurers conceded that Reeb was insured under both policies, but relied on the intentional act exclusion to deny coverage for the injuries sustained by Riley. This was also an exclusion RSA apparently reserved its rights on in the non-waiver agreement.</p>\n<p>Of particular note is that fact that prior to the hearing of the appeal, the plaintiff made a settlement offer under the policy limits of $1 million dollars under the mother&#8217;s homeowner&#8217;s policy. Acceptance of this offer would in effect result in no benefit to the insured from proceeding with the application since RSA had not denied coverage under the mother&#8217;s homeowner&#8217;s policy.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal raised the issue of whether there was an apparent conflict of interest in this case. Obviously, there was a significant financial benefit to RSA if the application was determined and the intentional act exclusion was found to apply under the two additional insurance policies. That finding would result in Reeb not having coverage under any of the insurance policies, including the RSA policy. Therefore, if the appeal failed, Reeb would likely have no insurance coverage whatsoever.</p>\n<p>When an insurer appoints counsel to represent the interest of its insured, a conflict of interest may arise where the interests of an insured and the interests of an insurance company are not aligned. The insured&#8217;s right to full and fair representation may be compromised. The case law requires a &#8220;degree of divergence&#8221; before a court can require an insurer to surrender control of the defence.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal applied the test as established in its recent decision of\u00a0<em>Hoang v. Vicentini</em><sup>2</sup>\u00a0to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of conflict of interest on the part of counsel appointed by the insurer:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The question is whether counsel&#8217;s mandate from the insurer can reasonably be said to conflict with his mandate to defend the insured in the civil action. Until that point is reached, the insured&#8217;s right to a defence and the insurer&#8217;s right to control that defence can satisfactorily co-exist.<sup>3</sup></p></blockquote>\n<p>The Court of Appeal held that in this case, there was a reasonable apprehension of a conflict between the interests of Reeb and RSA, which precluded the Court from ruling on the merits of the appeal. The Court directed that Reeb ought to have independent counsel or <em>amicus curiae</em> appointed to advise him of the suitability of bringing the application for a declaration in the face of the plaintiff&#8217;s settlement offer.</p>\n<p>Essentially, the Court of Appeal recognized that Reeb would be better off accepting the plaintiff&#8217;s settlement offer under the $1 million limit of his mother&#8217;s home owner&#8217;s policy, than continuing to pursue the application to determine if there was any coverage in excess of the limit, under the two additional insurance policies. RSA would either (i) provide coverage and pay the settlement amount or (ii) deny coverage on the basis of the intentional acts exclusion under the non-waiver and reservation of rights agreement.</p>\n<p>By bringing the underlying application, the insurer was essentially instructing defence counsel to take steps that were in conflict with the best interests of the insured. These were instructions that should never have been given and if given should have caused defence counsel to identify and flag the conflict. This is why the Court of Appeal directed that an independent counsel or\u00a0<em>amicus curiae</em>\u00a0should be appointed to assist the court with determining what future steps should be taken in the proceedings, and appointed\u00a0<em>amicus curiae</em>\u00a0in the interim.</p>\n<p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>\n<p><small>1 2017 ONCA 771 [&#8220;<em>Reeb</em>&#8220;].</small></p>\n<p><small>2 2016 ONCA 723 [&#8220;<em>Hoang</em>&#8220;].</small></p>\n<p><small>3\u00a0<em>Reeb</em>\u00a0at paragraph 14, citing\u00a0<em>Hoang</em>\u00a0at paragraph 74.</small></p>\n<p><small><em><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Melissa A.

Theall</strong>, Partner<br />\n&amp;<strong> Shaun A. Hashim</strong>, Litigation Associate</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In a potentially controversial ruling, an Ontario judge recently refused to grant two insured applicants full indemnity for costs on a motion related to the duty to defend. This decision is likely to create some confusion regarding an insured&#8217;s entitlement to full indemnity costs in duty to defend proceedings. Appellate authority has long established that when an insured applies to the court to enforce an insurer&#8217;s duty to defend, that insured is entitled to full indemnification for both the costs of the defence and the costs of the insured to litigate with the insurer over entitlement to the defence. However, in\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2018/2018onsc1010/2018onsc1010.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Lefeuvre v. Boekee</em></a>,<sup>1</sup>\u00a0the court may have deviated from this general principle.\u00a0<strong><div class=\"show_more\"><p class=\"wpsm-show\" style=\"color: 000000; font-size: 100%; text-align: center;\"> Show More</p><div class=\"wpsm-content wpsm-content-hide\"></strong></p>\n<p>In\u00a0<em>Lefeuvre</em>, the underlying case was a pedestrian/motor vehicle collision. Two municipalities had been sued in the action along with two winter maintenance companies. The two municipalities sought a defence from their insurers \u2014 however, those insurers were also defending the winter maintenance companies, who were adverse in interest. Due to this apparent conflict, the two municipalities brought a motion requesting that they be entitled to appoint and manage their own counsel at the insurer&#8217;s expense. The insurers admitted coverage for the defence but maintained that there was no conflict. In the result, the insureds were successful and independent counsel was ordered. The insureds sought their costs on a full indemnity basis.</p>\n<p>In additional reasons, the court concluded that full indemnity costs on the motion were not appropriate. Instead, the court applied the general rules for costs on a motion and found that the insureds were instead entitled to &#8220;reasonable indemnification&#8221;. In arriving at that conclusion, the court held that the costs of the motion were not legal fees owing under a contract but instead, simply costs under the\u00a0<em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em>.</p>\n<p>This ruling appears to be out of step with appellate authority which holds the costs borne by an insured to secure his or her right to a defence under an insurance policy should be paid on a full indemnity basis. The Ontario Court of Appeal has consistently held that the insured is &#8220;entitled to a defence &#8230; at no cost to them&#8221;.<sup>2</sup>In other words, an insured is &#8220;entitled to be made financially whole&#8221; for legal costs incurred in securing a defence under the policy.<sup>3</sup>\u00a0This broad principle has not only been used to indemnify insureds for their past defence costs, but also the future defence costs of counsel of their choice, the costs of the coverage application and the costs of any subsequent appeal.<sup>4</sup>\u00a0This principle of full indemnity is based, not in the law of costs, but in the law of contract. The &#8220;costs&#8221; of the insured on an application are in fact damages for a breach of the insurance contract. A successful insured is therefore entitled to be placed in the same position it would have been in had the contract been fulfilled. In duty to defend cases, that includes the legal expenses incurred by the insured to ensure their rights under contract are secured.<sup>5</sup></p>\n<p>Despite this accepted principle, the court in\u00a0<em>Lefeuvre</em>\u00a0\u2014 without relying on any prior authority \u2014\u00a0 held that the motion costs did not flow from any contractual right under the policy and were not &#8220;incurred in &#8216;defending&#8217; the action&#8221;. Instead, the court decided that the costs were incurred to &#8220;[interpret] the meaning and scope of the duty to defend&#8221;.\u00a0 The court further concluded that the insured&#8217;s right to costs flowed from &#8220;success on the motion&#8221; rather than the policy.\u00a0 In arriving at this conclusion, the court in\u00a0<em>Lefeuvre</em>\u00a0appears to have characterized the conflict of interest question as one defining the &#8220;extent&#8221; of the duty to defend and not necessarily a &#8220;breach&#8221; of that duty. This is problematic for two reasons.</p>\n<p>First, there is little difference between defining the &#8220;extent&#8221; of the duty to defend and determining whether there has been a breach of duty. In the face of a conflict of interest, an insurer&#8217;s refusal to rectify that conflict is better characterized as a breach of duty. To allow the defence to proceed with a conflict would have undoubtedly been a breach of the insurer&#8217;s obligations to the insured. Indeed, a conflicted defence is really no defence at all. As a result, the application to remove that conflict is not a mere question of &#8220;extent&#8221; or &#8220;interpretation&#8221;, but a matter of securing a definitive right to a defence under the policy. If the conflict of interest issue were characterized in this way, the insured&#8217;s right to full indemnity costs ought to have flowed from the principle that an insured should not to be put to expense in securing a defence under the policy.</p>\n<p>Second, in concluding that the question before it was one of &#8220;extent&#8221; and not a breach of duty, the court noted in\u00a0<em>obiter</em>\u00a0that the underlying action may deal with a &#8220;mixed&#8221; claim of covered and uncovered allegations. For that reason, the court decided that, even if it were wrong, a portion of the defence costs may relate to uncovered claims for which there would be no entitlement to indemnity. If the court relied on this reasoning, it would have been conflating the concept of indemnity on an application for coverage with the concept of an after-the-fact &#8220;allocation&#8221; of defence costs.</p>\n<p>The basis for such an allocation of defence costs was laid down in the Court of Appeal&#8217;s well-known decision in\u00a0<em>Hanis v. University of Western Ontario</em>.<sup>6</sup>\u00a0Contrary to the court&#8217;s suggestion in\u00a0<em>Lefeuvre</em>, the Court of Appeal in\u00a0<em>Hanis</em>\u00a0held that even in cases of &#8220;mixed&#8221; claims, &#8220;the insurer is required to pay all reasonable costs associated with the defence of [the underlying claim] even if those costs further the defence of uncovered claims&#8221;.<sup>7</sup>\u00a0It is only where the &#8220;costs [relate] solely to the defence of uncovered claims&#8221; that an insurer need not indemnify the insured.<sup>8</sup>\u00a0The decision that a portion of a claim is &#8220;solely&#8221; uncovered is a finding of fact that is generally dealt with after final resolution of the underlying matter. It is only in exceptional cases that an allocation can be reliably made at an early stage in the proceeding. In the absence of any findings of fact, the court in\u00a0<em>Lefeuvre\u00a0</em>could not have decided the allocation issue.</p>\n<p>In any event, an allocation of defence costs under\u00a0<em>Hanis</em>\u00a0is entirely distinct from the costs of an application to secure a defence under the policy. In an allocation case, there is no breach of duty. On a duty to defend application, the insurer&#8217;s breach is the central issue: the insured is forced to litigate in order to gain benefit of a conflict free defence under the policy.\u00a0 As noted above, damages for that breach of duty are the full indemnity costs of the application. Accordingly, where there is a breach of duty, the insured&#8217;s entitlement to full indemnity for the application costs would apply even if an allocation of subsequent defence costs were ordered.</p>\n<p>In the absence of confirmation of\u00a0<em>Lefeuvre</em>\u00a0from the Court of Appeal, the general rule remains: full indemnity is applicable to all breaches of the duty to defend. In any event, policyholders seeking coverage for defence costs are still encouraged to follow the best practice of addressing any potential conflict of interest issues as early as possible and ideally during the initial application for coverage.</p>\n<p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>\n<p><small>1\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2018/2018onsc1010/2018onsc1010.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Lefeuvre v.

In <em>The Brick Warehouse LP v. Chubb Insurance Company of Canada</em>,<a href=\"#_post-505ftn1\" name=\"_post-505ftnref1\">[1]</a> the Court held that a loss arising from social engineering fraud, did not meet the requirements for coverage under a commercial crime policy. This decision illustrates a significant gap in coverage under a crime policy for these types of cyber risks. <strong><div class=\"show_more\"><p class=\"wpsm-show\" style=\"color: 000000; font-size: 100%; text-align: center;\"> Show More</p><div class=\"wpsm-content wpsm-content-hide\"></strong></p>\n<p>The facts of this case should give pause to corporations, large and small alike. On multiple occasions, an individual contacted The Brick Warehouse&#8217;s (the &#8220;Brick&#8221;) accounts payable department, claiming to be from Toshiba, one of the Brick&#8217;s suppliers. Through a series of calls and emails, and under the pre-tense of being a new Toshiba employee, the individual was able to obtain information about the Brick&#8217;s payment process from a helpful Brick employee. Eventually, the individual advised the Brick that Toshiba had changed banks and requested that all payments be made to a new bank account. As requested, a Brick employee changed Toshiba&#8217;s bank information on the Brick&#8217;s payment system following the Brick&#8217;s standard practice.</p>\n<p>No one from the Brick took any independent steps to verify the change in bank accounts. No one contacted Toshiba, or any of the banks involved. The total amount transferred to the &#8220;new&#8221; fraudulent account was over $338,000.</p>\n<p>The fraud was discovered a few weeks later, when the fraudsters attempted to impersonate another Brick supplier, Sealy Canada, and gave the same bank-changing story and &#8220;new&#8221; bank account number. Fortunately for the Brick, because that account number was already associated with the Toshiba account, it could not be entered into the Brick payment system. A Brick employee contacted the number provided by the Toshiba imposters to make inquiries about the duplicate bank account number and the Toshiba imposter claimed Sealy and Toshiba had merged. However, while the Brick awaited further details of the alleged merger, a representative of Toshiba called to inquire why it had not received payment for recent invoices. That call started an investigation at the Brick that finally uncovered the fraud.</p>\n<p>The fraud was reported to the police and the Brick was able to recover $113,847 of the fraudulently transferred funds.</p>\n<p>The Brick was insured under a commercial crime policy issued by Chubb Insurance Company of Canada (&#8220;Chubb&#8221;). The Brick made a claim to Chubb for $224,475, the amount transferred less the recoveries. Chubb denied the claim on the basis that the Brick&#8217;s losses did not fall within the &#8220;fund transfer fraud&#8221; coverage.</p>\n<p>The Chubb policy defined funds transfer fraud as follows:</p>\n<p>Funds transfer fraud means the fraudulent written, electronic, telegraphic, cable, teletype or telephone instructions issued to a financial institution directing such institution to transfer, pay or deliver money or securities from any account maintained by an insured at such institution without an insured&#8217;s knowledge or consent.</p>\n<p>Since there was no doubt that funds were transferred out of the Brick&#8217;s account, the question really was whether the funds were transferred under instructions from an employee who did not &#8220;know&#8221; about or &#8220;consent&#8221; to the fraudulent transactions.</p>\n<p>The Court found that the Brick was not covered under the Chubb policy based on the wording of the &#8220;fund transfer fraud&#8221; provision, specifically the words &#8220;knowledge&#8221; and &#8220;consent&#8221;. Since &#8220;knowledge&#8221; and &#8220;consent&#8221; were undefined in the policy, the Court held the words should be given its plain and ordinary meaning. Ordinarily, consent can be defined as &#8220;permission for something to happen, or agreement to do something&#8221;. In this case, a Brick employee gave instructions to the bank to transfer funds. In so doing, the Court found, the employee &#8220;permitted&#8221; the bank to transfer funds out of the Brick&#8217;s account. Consequently, the transfer was completed with the Brick&#8217;s consent. Although the Brick employee may have been an unwitting pawn in the fraudster&#8217;s scheme, they were not forced or threatened to issue the instructions.</p>\n<p>The Court considered a California decision<a href=\"#_post-505ftn2\" name=\"_post-505ftnref2\">[2]</a> (as well as a line of pending cases in the US<a href=\"#_post-505ftn3\" name=\"_post-505ftnref3\">[3]</a>) with very similar facts: fraudulent emails were sent to a company employee who acted upon them, transferring money out of the insured&#8217;s account. The California court held that the insurer was not liable because the insured&#8217;s employee initiated the transfers.</p>\n<p>In this case, no coverage was afforded to the Brick because the Brick&#8217;s instructions to its bank were authorized by its employee, regardless of the fact that the employee was deceived by fraudsters into making those instructions. This leaves a significant gap in coverage for companies (and its employees) that fall prey to the manipulative tactics of skillful, social engineering fraudsters.</p>\n<p>This case is a cautionary tale: companies and organizations would be well-served to review internal controls to safeguard against these types of cyber risks, in addition to purchasing a robust crime policy, of course. In the commercial context, social engineering fraud depends on the fraudster establishing and manipulating employee trust. In this case, the fraudsters were successful because they were able gain valuable knowledge about the Brick&#8217;s internal procedures and payment information through a sequence of phone calls and emails with trusting Brick employees. To mitigate against employees unwittingly becoming pawns in a fraudster&#8217;s scheme, it is important to properly train and refresh staff on detecting and preventing fraud and implement appropriate cross-checks.</p>\n<p>Additionally, although cyber risks are still a relatively new peril in the insurance industry, cyber-crime is rapidly evolving. It is critical to review the scope of coverage, definitions and exclusions in a crime policy to ensure that your business or organization is adequately covered. As fraudsters continue to adapt quickly in today&#8217;s changing technological landscape, insured&#8217;s must remain ever vigilant and regularly re-assess their insurance needs.</p>\n<p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"#_post-505ftnref1\" name=\"_post-505ftn1\">[1]</a> 2017 ABQB 413</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_post-505ftnref2\" name=\"_post-505ftn2\">[2]</a> <em>Taylor and Lieberman v Federal Insurance Company</em>, 2:14-cv-03608, unreported.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_post-505ftnref3\" name=\"_post-505ftn3\">[3]</a> <em>Ameriforge Group Inc. v.

It is worth noting that the decision in <em>Medidata</em> was released July 21, 2017 and found that the &#8220;funds transfer fraud&#8221; provision covered the losses. In that case, a fraudster impersonated the president of the insured company and successfully directed an employee via email to transfer $4.8 million. While the employee knowingly initiated the transfer, the Court held that &#8220;larceny by trick is still larceny&#8221; and the employee&#8217;s knowledge and consent was only obtained by deception.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Camille M.

He attended the property as a guest of Family A. Family A had recently purchased the property from Family B. The applicant suffered significant injuries and applied for accident benefits, under his father&#8217;s insurance policy with Aviva Canada Inc. under the <em>Statutory Accident Benefit Schedule \u2014 Effective September 1, 2010</em> (the &#8220;Schedule&#8221;). <strong><a href=\"#post-179\"><div class=\"show_more\"><p class=\"wpsm-show\" style=\"color: 000000; font-size: 100%; text-align: center;\"> Show More</p><div class=\"wpsm-content wpsm-content-hide\"></a></strong></p>\n<p>Aviva paid the applicant accident benefits for eleven months, but later terminated benefits on the basis that the applicant&#8217;s claim did not meet the definition of an accident because the ATV was not an &#8220;automobile&#8221; under the Schedule. The Schedule does not define &#8220;automobile&#8221;.</p>\n<p>The test to determine whether the ATV is an &#8220;automobile&#8221; under the Schedule was established in <em>Grummett v. Federation Insurance Co. of Canada</em>,<a href=\"#_post-463ftn2\" name=\"_post-463ftnref2\">[2]</a> and affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <em>Adams v. Pineland Amusements Ltd.</em>,<a href=\"#_post-463ftn3\" name=\"_post-463ftnref3\">[3]</a> (generally referred to as the &#8220;<em>Adams</em>&#8221; test). It is a three step test, based on the following questions:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">i.\u00a0\u00a0 Is the vehicle an &#8220;automobile&#8221; in ordinary parlance?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If not, then,<br />\nii.\u00a0 Is the vehicle defined as an &#8220;automobile&#8221; in the wording of the insurance policy?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px; text-align: left;\">\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 If not, then,<br />\niii. Does the vehicle falls within any enlarged definition of &#8220;automobile&#8221; in any\u00a0\u00a0 relevant statute?</p>\n<p>An affirmative answer to any of the above questions meant that the vehicle is insured by the standard Ontario automobile insurance contract.</p>\n<p>The issue in this case turned on who owned the ATV at the time of the incident. Specifically, whether there had been a verbal agreement for Family A to purchase the ATV from Family B prior to the incident. This is because section 15(9) of the <em>Off-Road Vehicles Act</em> (&#8220;ORVA&#8221;) provides that insurance is not required for an ATV if it is driven on private property of the owner of the ATV. If the ATV was exempt from being insured, it could not qualify as an automobile under the Schedule and the applicant would have no entitlement to accident benefits.</p>\n<p>The decision focused on (iii) of the <em>Adams</em> test and whether the ATV falls within a definition of &#8220;automobile&#8221; in any relevant statute.</p>\n<p>Section 224 of the Insurance Act defines an automobile as follows:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">a. a motor vehicle required under any act to be insured under a motor vehicle liability policy; and<br />\nb. a vehicle prescribed by regulation.</p>\n<p>In this case, both parties agreed that the ATV met the definition of an &#8220;off-road vehicle&#8221;, under the Off-Road Vehicles Act (&#8220;ORVA&#8221;):</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;off-road vehicle&#8221; means a vehicle propelled or driven otherwise than by muscular power or wind and designed to travel,</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">a. on not more than three wheels, or<br />\nb. on more than three wheels and being of a prescribed class of vehicle; (&#8220;v\u00e9hicule tout terrain&#8221;)</p>\n<p>Generally, the ORVA requires that off-road vehicles be insured when operated, but there is an exception in subsection 15(9) of the ORVA as mentioned above, which hinges on ownership. The determination of ownership of the ATV as at the date of loss was therefore critical to whether the ATV qualified as an automobile under (iii) of the <em>Adams</em> test.</p>\n<p>The respondent Aviva argued that Family B owned the ATV at the time of the incident. The ATV was therefore not required to be insured, as it met the exemption in 15(9) of the ORVA.</p>\n<p>The applicant argued that Family A owned the ATV at the time of the incident. As the incident took place on the property of Family B, it could not meet the exemption in 15(9) of the ORVA and would have required insurance.</p>\n<p>The adjudicator found that the ATV was owned by Family B at the time of the accident, meaning that the ATV did not meet (iii) of the <em>Adams</em> test and the ATV did not qualify as an automobile under the Schedule.</p>\n<p>The adjudicator&#8217;s reasons emphasized the applicant&#8217;s evidence as to ownership was insufficient, as no evidence directly in support of this application from either Family A or B was submitted. Rather, the evidence submitted was an affidavit made in support of third party litigation against the insurance company.</p>\n<p>The applicant was therefore not entitled to accident benefits, and was not entitled to any award under the Ontario Regulation 664, which provides for a lump sum award of up to 50% of the amount to which a person is entitled under the Schedule.</p>\n<p>The applicant also argued that the respondent Aviva was estopped from denying accident benefits coverage because they had paid the applicant for eleven months. In denying this argument, the adjudicator noted that the administrative Tribunal (which is now the exclusive venue for accident benefits disputes) has no jurisdiction to grant equitable relief.</p>\n<p>This case is an interesting reminder of the insurance coverage issues that can arise from accidents involving ATVs, and builds on earlier jurisprudence concerning ATVs. For example, the Court of Appeal for Ontario in <em>Matheson v. Lewis</em><a href=\"#_post-463ftn4\" name=\"_post-463ftnref4\">[4]</a> clarified that ATVs are subject to the province&#8217;s compulsory motor vehicle liability insurance regime when operated on land not occupied by the owner.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal noted in <em>Matheson v. Lewis</em> that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Section 15 of the ORVA prohibits a person from driving an off-road vehicle on land not occupied by the owner of the vehicle unless it is insured under a motor vehicle liability policy in accordance with the <em>Insurance Act</em>.</li>\n<li><em>Highway Traffic Act</em>, O. Reg.316/03, provides that an off-road vehicle shall not be operated on a highway unless it is insured in accordance with s. 2 of the <em>Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act</em> and s. 15 of the ORVA.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Therefore, insureds owning ATVs would be prudent to ensure that their ATVs are insured where they will be: (i) driven by anyone other than the ATV owner; or (ii) driven on property other than the ATV owner&#8217;s property.</p>\n<p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"#_post-463ftnref1\" name=\"_post-463ftn1\">[1]</a> <em>16-003674 v.

Theall</strong>, Partner<br />\n&amp;<strong> Shaun A. Hashim</strong>, Litigation Associate</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ontario&#8217;s two year limitation period often becomes a trap for unwary policy holders who suffer a property loss. It is not uncommon to see claims drag on through the adjusting process, with interim payments being made, only to have insurers deny some or all of the claim more than two years after the loss. When the insured sues, insurers then claim the action is statute barred \u2014 a position our courts have accepted in a number of cases. A recent decision by Justice Paul Perell provides the insured with some relief from this trap. <strong><div class=\"show_more\"><p class=\"wpsm-show\" style=\"color: 000000; font-size: 100%; text-align: center;\"> Show More</p><div class=\"wpsm-content wpsm-content-hide\"> </strong>In <em>Nasr Hospitality Services Inc. v. Intact Insurance</em> (&#8220;<em>Nasr</em>&#8220;),<a href=\"#_post-198ftn1\" name=\"_post-198ftnref1\">[1]</a> Justice Perell confirmed that even though your claim may <em>arise</em> on the date of loss, it is not necessarily fully &#8220;discovered&#8221; until a later date. He concluded that where an insurer began paying on a property loss, a coverage claim was not discoverable until the insurer communicated a clear repudiation of its obligation to indemnify the insured.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The test to establish when the limitation period commenced was whether the insured had knowledge of all of the material facts of the claim <em>and</em> that a legal action would be &#8220;appropriate&#8221; in the circumstances. The question of &#8220;appropriateness&#8221; was critical to the Court&#8217;s decision. Most claims for insurance involve some period of negotiation between the insured and the insurer. During this period, it is not typical for the parties to seriously consider litigation, particularly where interim payments are being made. In <em>Nasr</em>, the Court has signalled that a formal denial letter is a signpost marking the end of negotiations and the commencement of a period in which litigation is legally &#8220;appropriate&#8221; \u2014 at which point the claim is &#8220;discovered&#8221; and the limitation period begins to run. This is especially true when, before serving the formal denial letter, the insurer makes payments under the policy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Court cautioned that determining the &#8220;appropriateness&#8221; of a legal proceeding is a factual analysis dependent on the circumstances. This means that the date of a formal denial letter will not always be the date in which the limitation period begins.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Decision in <em>Nasr</em></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On January 31, 2013, a business property owned by Nasr Hospitality Services Inc. (the insured) was flooded. The insured promptly reported the loss to its insurer, Intact Insurance. Between that date and June 2013, Intact paid portions of the insured&#8217;s claim for business interruption losses and utility costs. In that period, the insured delivered several proof of loss forms for property damage which were rejected. On July 22, 2013, Intact formally denied the property damage claim. The insured commenced its action for coverage on April 22, 2015.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The question for the Court was therefore: when did the two-year limitation period begin to run, on the date of loss or at some later date?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Justice Perell began with the basic statement of the law on discoverability. He noted that the earliest date a claim may be discovered is the day when &#8220;the plaintiff discovers the underlying material facts&#8221; (i.e. the subjective requirement) or, alternatively, when the plaintiff &#8220;ought to have discovered those facts by the exercise of reasonable diligence&#8221; (i.e. the objective requirement).<a href=\"#_post-198ftn2\" name=\"_post-198ftnref2\">[2]</a> If the plaintiff has either subjective or objective knowledge, a claim may be considered &#8220;ripe&#8221; and a limitation period may run.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, the plaintiff&#8217;s knowledge of material facts is not the end of the analysis. Justice Perell recognized that section 5(1)(a)(iv) of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em> requires that the plaintiff must also know that a legal proceeding would be &#8220;an appropriate means to seek to remedy&#8221; his or her potential claim. If knowledge of material facts is established, the question then becomes, when was it appropriate to bring a legal proceeding?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To determine the meaning of &#8220;appropriate&#8221;, Justice Perell thoroughly reviewed the jurisprudence interpreting this postponement provision. In doing so, he reviewed Justice Sharpe&#8217;s decision in <em>Markel Insurance Co of Canada v. ING Insurance Co of Canada</em>. In that case, Justice Sharpe held:</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8230; the word &#8220;appropriate&#8221; must mean legally appropriate. To give &#8220;appropriate&#8221; an evaluative gloss, allowing a party to delay the commencement of proceedings for some tactical or other reason beyond two years from the date the claim is fully ripened and requiring the court to assess to tone and tenor of communications in search of a clear denial would, in my opinion, inject an unacceptable element of uncertainty into the law of limitation of actions.<a href=\"#_post-198ftn3\" name=\"_post-198ftnref3\">[3]</a></p>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Justice Sharpe&#8217;s decision in <em>Markel</em> highlights the dangerous uncertainty the &#8220;appropriateness&#8221; factor could introduce into a limitations analysis. Upon his review of the jurisprudence, Justice Perell concluded that the &#8220;appropriateness&#8221; analysis must accord with the policies behind limitation periods, which include three purposes:</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8230; (1) to promote accuracy and certainty in the adjudication of claims; (2) to provide fairness to persons who might be required to defend against claims based on stale evidence; and (3) to prompt persons who might wish to commence claims to be diligent in pursuing them in a timely fashion Having regard to these principles, and on the basis of the facts before him, Justice Perell decided that the limitation period for the insured in <em>Nasr</em> began to run from the date upon which Intact formally denied the claim in July 2013. In doing so he assumed, without deciding, that the plaintiff&#8217;s claim would have been &#8220;ripe&#8221; on the date of loss on February 1, 2013. Having regard to the fact that Intact had made $42,000 in payments from the date the claim was &#8220;ripe&#8221; until its denial, Justice Perell concluded that the limitation period was postponed until the formal denial in July 2013.</p>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although on its face, this analysis may be a review of the &#8220;tone and tenor&#8221; of the communications between the parties \u2014 which Justice Sharpe had cautioned against \u2014 it was clear from the facts of <em>Nasr</em> that, up to the date of the formal denial letter, litigation would have been premature.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Conclusions</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The decision in <em>Nasr</em> is important because it confirms that the date of loss for a property is not necessarily the date when the statutory limitation period commences. This is true even if the plaintiff can be said to have knowledge of all necessary material facts on that date. Instead, in situations where there are ongoing negotiations between an insured and an insurer, and where the insurer has made payments for portions of the claim, the limitation period may be postponed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is also important to note that while Justice Perell applied the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>, he did not expressly address whether insurers can contract out of its discovery provisions in the case of business contracts. The <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>, permits an insurer to &#8220;vary&#8221; the limitation period for commercial contracts, which includes the power to &#8220;extend, shorten and suspend&#8221; the statutory period. However, the <em>Act</em> does not specifically state whether insurers can contract out of discoverability. In addition, it is important to note that <em>Nasr</em> does not change the law as it applies to Statutory Condition 14,<a href=\"#_post-198ftn4\" name=\"_post-198ftnref4\">[4]</a> which bars claims under fire insurance policies brought more than <strong>one year</strong> after the date of loss. It is common for property insurers to incorporate Statutory Condition 14 into its other property coverage. In such policies, the Statutory Condition becomes a contractual limitation period.<a href=\"#_post-198ftn5\" name=\"_post-198ftnref5\">[5]</a> Because Statutory Condition 14 specifically references the date of loss as the date upon which the limitation period begins to run, incorporation of this clause into an insurance policy raises questions of enforceability. In effect, Statutory Condition 14 not only shortens the limitation period but also purports to eliminate discoverability. In these cases, it remains unsettled whether the discoverability principles set out in the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em> (and discussed in <em>Nasr</em>) will apply.<a href=\"#_post-198ftn6\" name=\"_post-198ftnref6\">[6]</a> It can be argued that a provision incorporating the entire limitation clause set out in Statutory Condition 14 into an insurance policy is void, as it is not permitted by the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>. Notwithstanding the result in <em>Nasr</em>, the best practice for insureds and their counsel is to treat the date of loss as start of the limitation period, and assume that any claim must be commenced within two years from the date of loss, or one year if the policy incorporates Statutory Condition 14. As Justice Perell noted, the &#8220;appropriateness&#8221; inquiry is one of &#8220;facts and circumstances&#8221;. Although ongoing negotiations and payments may stop the clock, a claim may be considered &#8220;ripe&#8221; on the date of loss. In the face of lengthy negotiations, an insured or their counsel should not risk allowing a ripe claim to die on the vine.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"#_post-198ftnref1\" name=\"_post-198ftn1\">[1]</a> <em>Nasr Hospitality Services Inc. v.
