The Plan would consist of two mine pit sequences, out of pit topsoil, overburden, and bentonite stockpiles, and haul roads. The life of the mine is an estimated 10-20 years. The area will be strip mined using the cast-back mining technique, which can allow for concurrent reclamation. The haul road will be present throughout the life of the mine. It is estimated that 2-3 acres of each pit will be open at a given time. The Area of Potential Effect has been defined as the physical footprint of the mining operation, associated surface disturbance (direct), and the visual horizon (indirect), not to exceed three miles. The BLM is requiring a Class III inventory of the projects direct APE, and a Class II inventory of the indirect APE.

Additionally, the Class II inventory has not been completed. No reports have been submitted to the BLM. This undertaking is expected to have direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on historic properties within the APE. Direct impacts will be associated with surface disturbances associated with mining operations and construction of a haul road. Indirect impacts will primarily be visual and will occur to historic properties such as petroglyph sites and historic cairns, where surface disturbance can be seen by the casual viewer.
